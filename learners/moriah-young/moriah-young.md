## About Me
- **Name:** Moriah Young  
- **Affiliation:** Michigan State University  
- **Email:** youngmor@msu.edu  

## Research Interests
My research focuses broadly on understanding how soil microbial and plant communities respond to climate stressors and also how soil microbes mediate aboveground responses to those stressors. At this summit, I'm really excited to expand my knowledge of open science principles and to use cutting-edge computational methods for analyzing large-scale ecological datasets to understand environmental tipping points and transformations!

## Fun Fact
I love to play ultimate frisbee, and I collect Lake Superior agates and Great Lakes fossils.
