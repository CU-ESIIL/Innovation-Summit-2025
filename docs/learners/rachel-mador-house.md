I am a geneticist and love using genetics to help us understand our environment and health. Currently I work as a private consultant for three genomics-based companies and am honoured to be on the ESIIL advisory board.  

## Fun Fact
Tattooing is illegal in South Korea, so naturally this is where I got my first tattoo while living there and teaching English.
