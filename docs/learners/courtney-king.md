## About Me
- **Name:** Courtney King
- **Affiliation:** Michigan Technological University  
- **Email:** clking@mtu.edu  

## Research Interests
I’m studying the movements and behaviors — including foraging, predator avoidance, and habitat selection — of moose on Isle Royale National Park. I am interested in how the decisions of moose are impacted by ecological interactions and environmental conditions, and how they in-turn influence the forests in which they reside. I am particularly interested in big data, image classification, and utilizing/improving approaches to better understand the environment (snow, forest structure and composition, forest health, etc.) via remote sensing.

## Fun Fact
I lived in western Colorado previously, and am excited to be back! After the summit I'll be running a marathon near Paonia, CO.
