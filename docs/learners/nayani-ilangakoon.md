## About Me
- **Name:** Nayani Ilangakoon 
- **Affiliation:** Earth Lab, University of Colorado Boulder  
- **Email:** ginikanda.ilangakoon@colorado.edu  

## Research Interests
I study forest disturbances and state changes, focusing on how we can recognize and support ecosystems before critical transitions occur, using cutting-edge remote sensing and in-situ data. I am particularly interested in learning and connecting teams around machine learning, AI, and diverse ways of knowing to better understand ecosystem responses.  

## Fun Fact
I love traveling to new places and spending time with my family.
