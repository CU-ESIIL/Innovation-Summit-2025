## About Me
- **Name:** Cullen Molitor  
- **Affiliation:** CEGA (Center for Effective Global Action), UC Berkeley
- **Email:** cmolitor@berkeley.edu 

## Research Interests
I work on applying remote sensing and machine learning to understand how climate change affects human wellbeing and the environment. I'm particularly interested in using earth observation and microdata to develop data-driven solutions for climate change response, and I lead workshops through the Togo Data Lab to empower local researchers and policymakers in resource-constrained settings.

## Fun Fact
I'm a former scientific diver who contributed to the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program at Channel Islands National Park, and I still explore California's Channel Islands kelp forest ecosystems in my free time!
