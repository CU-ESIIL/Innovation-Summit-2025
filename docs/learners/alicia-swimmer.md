## About Me
- **Name:** Alicia Swimmer
- **Affiliation:** Rosebud Sioux Tribe
- **Email:** aliciaswimmer@gmail.com  

## Research Interests
I am very excited to help protect the ancestral lands of the Oceti Sakowin, referred to in treaties as the "Sioux Nation of Indians. As a Sicangu & Oglala Lakota Winyan, I have an obligation to help the Oyate for the next seven generations. I am excited to connect with others who can help protect our home, Unci Maka (Earth).  

## Fun Fact
I was born with my two bottom teeth. In my culture, it means I am an elder who came back. If I were born during the Salem witch trials, my mom and I would be regarded as witches. Either way, it's cool.
