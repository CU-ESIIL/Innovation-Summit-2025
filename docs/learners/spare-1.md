## Research Interests
I’m a forest, landscape, and disturbance ecologist, starting as an assistant professor at CU Boulder in 2026 (CIRES and EBIO). In my work, I evaluate the spatial and temporal relationships between vegetation, climate, and disturbances such as fire, drought, cyclonic storms, and deforestation. Most recently, I’m interested in forest response to and recovery from fire and the post-fire impacts on forest ecosystem services like carbon storage and water resources. 

## Fun Fact
I'm from Wyoming!
