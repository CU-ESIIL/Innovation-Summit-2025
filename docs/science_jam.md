# Science Jam
**Starting the Process: Alignment of Topics + Data + Products** 

**Goal:** Match people with a topic they are interested in and a product that is exciting to them ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

## Topics
1. Defining tipping points, (ecological) collapse, and transformation/regime shift
2. Understanding environmental drivers and thresholds of tipping points: climate change, fire, drought, land use change, compound disturbances
3. Understanding social drivers and thresholds of tipping points: social-ecological systems, community vulnerability, and governance 
4. Detecting and predicting tipping points: past and future 
5. Understanding environmental impacts of transformation on ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage, biodiversity, water quality)
6. Understanding social impacts of transformation on people and society
7. Applying management and adaptation strategies for ecosystem resilience

## Products
During the Summit, you will have the opportunity to dive into relevant data to contribute to product, such as:
1. Co-author publications on new methods, syntheses, or perspectives
2. Coâ€‘develop grant proposals
3. Create resources: educational resources, data products, or workflows that advance open science
4. Formulate strategies to engage stakeholders with tools, guidelines, or applications
