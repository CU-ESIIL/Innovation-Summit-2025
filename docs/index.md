### Explore Boulder Like a Local!
Want to get out to explore while you’re here? [This website](https://www.bouldercoloradousa.com/things-to-do/) has lots of information on things to do in Boulder, such as shopping, restaurants, nightlife, and much more!

### Weather and Packing
Boulder is 5,430 feet in elevation and has a sunny, semi-arid climate. Hydrating during your stay is very important, as altitude sickness (headache, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness) can occur. Weather conditions can change rapidly throughout each day and from day to day. Layers are always a good choice. In summer months, average high daily temperatures are in the 80s and 90s, with lows in the 50s and 60s. The sun is strong in Boulder, so please bring sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. Afternoon thunderstorms aren’t unusual, so a rain jacket is helpful. There are many trails near Boulder, so hiking or running shoes and a set of workout clothes can help get you outside during your stay.

### Technology Needs
The Summit will give participants an opportunity to collaborate with each other on environmental data sets in real time. We would like you to bring a laptop/notebook that has the ability to connect to the internet (don’t forget your chargers!). If you do not have one that you can bring with you, please email esiil@colorado.edu, as we may be able to request a few rentals from the university library.

CU Boulder has set negotiated rates with hotels all around Boulder and the surrounding area, which should provide some different options depending on your budget. Of these hotels, the **Marriott Boulder**, **Residence Inn Boulder Canyon Boulevard**, **Hilton Garden Inn**, and **Embassy Suites** by Hilton Boulder are the closest to CU Boulder’s East Campus. The Hotel Boulderado and the St. Julien Hotel and Spa are further from East Campus, but are within walking distance of Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall–a lively, walking-only street with many shops and restaurants.

When booking with one of these hotels [instructions on the site](https://www.cu.edu/psc/travel/preferred-hotel-program-local/preferred-hotel-program-local-ucb), note that you need to mention “The University of Colorado special rate” and that you will be staying for a university-sponsored event. You should be able to get these rates up until the day before the event, but we recommend booking sooner than later to ensure that there is space at your preferred location.

## Transportation

### Air Transportation
If you are flying in for the event you will want to fly into the Denver International Airport (DIA). Note that the airport is quite large and you will need to take an airport train to the main terminal.

### Ground Transportation
**Ride Share**
A Lyft or Uber or airport taxi are the most expensive option but also the most direct way to get from the airport to Boulder (often $70 or higher one way).


**Public transportation to/from airport**
Transit from the Denver airport to Boulder is quite easy via the **AB1 Boulder/Denver** airport bus. This bus runs at least once an hour during the day, with more frequent trips at popular times. To locate the bus, follow signs in the Denver airport baggage claim area to ‘Train to city,’ which will lead you down an escalator. At the base of the escalator, instead of continuing straight towards the visible train station, turn left and you should see a bus terminal with an RTD ticket machine. Tickets for the AB1 can be purchased for $10. Find the gate for the AB1 / Downtown Boulder line.

**Airport Shuttle Services**
If you would prefer to book a shuttle to/from DIA (Denver International Airport) & Boulder, there are three options:

* Green Ride Boulder: www.greenrideboulder.com 303-997-0238
* SuperShuttle: www.supershuttle.com 800-258-3826
* Eight Black Shuttle: https://eightblackairportshuttle.com 720-223-5474

**Car Rentals**
There are a number of rental car agencies located at the Denver International Airport:

* Advantage: www.advantage.com
* Alamo: www.alamo.com
* Avis: www.avis.com
* Budget: www.budget.com
* Dollar: www.dollar.com
* Enterprise: www.enterprise.com
* Hertz: www.hertz.com
* National: www.nationalcar.com
* Payless: www.paylesscarrental.com

**Additional car rental options include:**

* eGo CarShare
* Zipcar

### Transportation around the Boulder area
Boulder has a number of public transportation options for traversing Boulder and the surrounding area.
**Bus lines**
[Information about Boulder’s local bus network can be found here](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/goboulder/bus). Note that the Skip, Bound, and Hop lines pass campus regularly.
If you need to travel to Denver for any reason, the [Flatiron Flyer](https://www.rtd-denver.com/services/flatiron-flyer) bus connects Denver to Boulder. Currently the FF1 is the best option, and connects Denver’s Union Station to the Downtown Boulder Station (with numerous stops in-between).

**Biking & Walking**
Boulder has an extensive system of city walking/biking paths; [maps can be found here](https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/multi-use-paths). [Boulder B-Cycle](https://boulder.bcycle.com/nav/start-riding) is a community non-profit bike sharing system with daily and month passes available.


*This event is hosted by ESIIL and funded by the National Science Foundation (via award # DBI-2153040), and subject to the NSF’s terms and conditions.
