!!! Success "Almost here!"

    September 23-25, 2025

    University of Colorado Boulder 
    

# Welcome to the 2025 ESIIL Innovation Summit
The 2025 ESIIL Innovation Summit will focus on **environmental tipping points and transformations**, bringing together scientists, managers, data analysts, and other thought leaders to address environmental challenges. 

Environmental tipping points—also known as state changes, regime shifts, or type conversions—can occur gradually or suddenly, at varying scales, and significantly alter the ecosystems that sustain life on Earth. Understanding these past and future  transformations and ecological contexts that shape them, is critical for predicting, managing, and mitigating their impacts on both nature and society.

The 2025 Summit will offer a unique, data-driven opportunity to explore environmental tipping points and transformations through big data. You will work alongside a collaborative group of peers to identify and understand the factors driving these changes and advance data-informed strategies for responding to them.

## What to Expect at the Summit
The Summit will take the form of an **‘unconference’**, a flexible and interactive event designed to foster **collaboration and innovation**. Attendees are encouraged to participate in discussions, workgroups, and brainstorming sessions centered around the themes that interest them most. The format encourages **co-creation** of solutions, with ample opportunities for spontaneous interactions and cross-disciplinary teamwork.

What past attendees had to say:

- “The ESIIL Innovation Summit brings together people… to gain hands-on experience developing innovative science questions, big data tools, and working in a collaborative team.”
- “Get ready to work hard and to grow. You’ll meet a lot of great people from diverse backgrounds.”
- “A highlight of the Summit was the general atmosphere and community. There’s palpable excitement. The unconference format is different from a typical conference, so people don’t always know what to expect—but that’s part of what makes it so engaging.”

## Weather and Packing
Boulder is 5,430 feet in elevation and has a sunny, semi-arid climate. Hydrating during your stay is very important, as altitude sickness (headache, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness) can occur.

Weather conditions can change rapidly throughout each day and from day to day. Layers are always a good choice.

The average temperature in Boulder in September for a typical day ranges from a high of 75.4°F (24.1°C) to a low of 48.3°F (9°C). Some would describe the temperature to be moderately chilly. The general area may also feel breezy. The sun is strong in Boulder, so please bring sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. There are many trails near Boulder, so hiking or running shoes and a set of workout clothes can help get you outside during your stay.

## Transportation

### Air Transportation
If you are flying in for the event you will want to fly into the Denver International Airport (DIA). Note that the airport is quite large and you will need to take an airport train to the main terminal.

### Ground Transportation
**Ride Share**
A Lyft or Uber or airport taxi are the most expensive option but also the most direct way to get from the airport to Boulder (often $70 or higher one way).


**Public transportation to/from airport**
Transit from the Denver airport to Boulder is quite easy via the **AB1 Boulder/Denver** airport bus. This bus runs at least once an hour during the day, with more frequent trips at popular times. To locate the bus, follow signs in the Denver airport baggage claim area to ‘Train to city,’ which will lead you down an escalator. At the base of the escalator, instead of continuing straight towards the visible train station, turn left and you should see a bus terminal with an RTD ticket machine. Tickets for the AB1 can be purchased for $10. Find the gate for the AB1 / Downtown Boulder line.

**Airport Shuttle Services**
If you would prefer to book a shuttle to/from DIA (Denver International Airport) & Boulder:

* SuperShuttle: www.supershuttle.com 800-258-3826

**Car Rentals**
There are a number of rental car agencies located at the Denver International Airport:

* Advantage: www.advantage.com
* Alamo: www.alamo.com
* Avis: www.avis.com
* Budget: www.budget.com
* Dollar: www.dollar.com
* Enterprise: www.enterprise.com
* Hertz: www.hertz.com
* National: www.nationalcar.com
* Payless: www.paylesscarrental.com

**Additional car rental options include:**

* eGo CarShare
* Zipcar

### Transportation around the Boulder area
Boulder has a number of public transportation options for traversing Boulder and the surrounding area


**Bus lines**
[Information about Boulder’s local bus network can be found here](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/goboulder/bus). Note that the Skip, Bound, and Hop lines pass campus regularly.

If you need to travel to Denver for any reason, the [Flatiron Flyer](https://www.rtd-denver.com/services/flatiron-flyer) bus connects Denver to Boulder. Currently the FF1 is the best option, and connects Denver’s Union Station to the Downtown Boulder Station (with numerous stops in-between).

**Biking & Walking**
Boulder has an extensive system of city walking/biking paths; [maps can be found here](https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/multi-use-paths). [Boulder B-Cycle](https://boulder.bcycle.com/nav/start-riding) is a community non-profit bike sharing system with daily and month passes available.


*This event is hosted by ESIIL and funded by the National Science Foundation (via award # DBI-2153040), and subject to the NSF’s terms and conditions.
